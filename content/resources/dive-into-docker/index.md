Docker is a powerful DevOps tool that allows you to maintain, structure, and deploy your applications in a containerized way. You can configure Docker to keep parts of your application (back end, front end, microservices, etc.) separated into these "containers". Docker is conceptually similar to using Virtual Machines, but it manages resources much differently (and often more efficiently) at a hardware level. Using Docker is also a good way to manage your application's dependencies. Docker can be a bit tough to get into, but Nick Janetakis does a great job of making the concepts easy to understand in this course.
