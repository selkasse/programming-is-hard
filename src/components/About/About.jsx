          Being a developer is awesome.  It can be challenging at times, but that&apos;s part of what makes it awesome.  It&apos;s also what turns a lot of people away, or makes them give up on it.  There have been times where I wonder if I have chosen the right career path because I did not feel like a competent developer.  Others seem to pick it up quicker, find it easier, and are just plain better at it than me.  I used to be so intimidated when I heard terms like &quot;API&quot;, &quot;Frontend Framework&quot;, or when people would ask me about my &quot;stack&quot;.  Googling things would lead me to pages that I didn&apos;t understand, and made me doubt myself even more. The goal of this blog is to eliminate that feeling of intimidation, of inadequacy. I want to provide easy-to-provide solutions to developers who have asked the same questions I have, had the same frustrations I&apos;ve had. I want to show other developers that they can take on any topic, so long as they have some time, a little patience, and a practical approach.

        <h2>Content</h2>
        <p>
          The type of content you can expect to see here will be focused on learning, approaches, mindsets, and experiences. Another way to say that is: I post about things that gave me trouble, but I eventually figured out. Specifically, I post about how I figured it out, and break it down in hopes that anyone reading doesn&apos;t have to. Expect to see detailed code examples with detailed explanations. Some content may be influenced by opinion, but that opinion is influenced by experience. I do not claim to know the best way to do something, or the best tools to use.  I am simply sharing what I have found works for me, what does not, and why.  That being said, I aim to provide answers to the questions that other developers might have, while also encouraging a positive, productive mindset.  I want my posts to bring understanding, and fill in the gaps that I know I needed to fill to get where I am today. I sincerely hope you enjoy the reading!

        <h2>Suggestions</h2>
        <p>
          If there&apos;s something you would like to see me post about, or if you want to provide feedback on the content itself, please let me know! I know that I might be posting about Gatsby, while you&apos;re working through issues in Vue. I might make a post about Digital Ocean, but you have a question about Linode.  And that&apos;s okay! Send me an email with the topic you&apos;d like me to cover, and there is a good chance I will write about it. The chances of me writing about a suggested topic depend on my familiarity with the topic, and how long it would take me to resarch. I should have a comments section set up in the future to make suggestions and feedback more streamlined.

        <h2>Collaboration</h2>
        <p>
          As of right now, The Engine is a solo endeavor. However, if you feel like you have knowledge that you can share, and it aligns with the type of content here, then I would be glad to feature your post on the blog! If you&apos;re interested, email me your blog post, a quick bio, and any social media links you want to include in the bio.
